Bio from General Sar: "As the co-host of Ordinals Saga, I want to bring forth genuine, honest and open-minded conversation into the Ordinals space in order to improve the space one building block at a time. I want to leave the fake niceties, the fake hype and the cheerleading out of the ordinals ecosystem and I want genuine projects who are delivering something to win on Bitcoin. As the world's most in-demand digital asset becomes a digital canvas available to artists, memers and coders alike, Ordinals Saga takes you on an educational and entertaining journey to DISCOVER projects from the Shadow Hats to the Shrooms, UNCOVER the meaning of special sats, and we even share honest, non-sugar coated opinions and thoughts on how we RECOVER from the bear market, looking to the next cycle."
