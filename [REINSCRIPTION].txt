[Reinscription/Re-Inscription]

Reinscription in Ordinals is the concept of inscribing on a satoshi that has already been inscribed on before.
As inscriptions are immutable, and cannot be changed once inscribed, reinscription stacks multiple inscriptions on a single satoshi.
This means you can have one satoshi that has multiple inscriptions on it!
You absolutely can re-inscribe on a satoshi that has already been inscribed on by another user.
